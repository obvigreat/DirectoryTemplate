## 5. Accessibility & Performance

### 5.1. Accessibility Considerations
- **Contrast Ratios:**  
  - Ensure text meets or exceeds WCAG guidelines (e.g., black on white for body text).

- **Image Optimization:**  
  - Use responsive images that adjust based on the device and network conditions.
  
- **Lazy Loading:**  
  - Implement lazy loading for images in article listings and community pages to improve page speed.
